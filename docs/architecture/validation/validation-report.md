## Category 1: C4 Diagrams & Dependency Graph (B1)

**Auditor**: Phase B1
**Files verified**:
- `docs/architecture/system-context.mermaid`
- `docs/architecture/container-diagram.mermaid`

| Undocumented: Spinner interface | INFO | Minor CLI utility interface |
| Undocumented: ColorProvider interface | INFO | Minor UI utility interface |
| Undocumented: ProgressReporterFunc type | INFO | Functional adapter, not a primary interface |

### Corrections Applied

1. **BumpAllocator.AllocFermatSlice**: Parameter signature corrected to match actual source
2. **EstimateBumpCapacity**: Safety margin documented as 10% (was incorrectly stated as 20%)

### Notes

4 minor interfaces were identified as undocumented (TempAllocator, Spinner, ColorProvider, ProgressReporterFunc). These are internal utility types that do not materially affect architectural understanding. Marked as INFO rather than WARNING since they are implementation details.

2. **Architecture README Data Flow**: Rewrote 9-step flow to match actual call chain verified against source code

### New Documentation Created

4 detailed flow documents with Mermaid sequence diagrams:

| Document | Content |
|----------|---------|
| `flows/cli-flow.md` | Complete CLI mode execution path: `main()` -> `app.New()` -> `app.Run()` -> orchestration -> output |
| `flows/tui-flow.md` | TUI mode execution path: dispatch -> `tui.Run()` -> Bubble Tea model lifecycle |
| `flows/config-flow.md` | Configuration resolution: CLI flags -> env vars -> calibration profile -> adaptive estimation -> defaults |
| `flows/algorithm-flows.md` | Per-algorithm execution: FibCalculator decorator -> DoublingFramework / MatrixFramework -> strategy dispatch |

## Summary of All Corrections

| Phase | Category | Corrections | Files Modified |
|-------|----------|-------------|----------------|
| B1 | C4 Diagrams | 37+ | 3 mermaid files |
| B2 | Interfaces & Patterns | 2 | architecture README, patterns doc |
| B3 | Execution Flows | 2 + 4 new docs | README.md, architecture README, 4 new flow docs |

| **Total** | | **53+ corrections** | **14 files** |

---

## Remaining Recommendations

1. **Minor undocumented interfaces**: Consider adding brief mentions of `TempAllocator`, `Spinner`, `ColorProvider`, and `ProgressReporterFunc` to the design patterns document if they grow in importance
2. **Automated validation**: Consider adding a CI step that verifies interface signatures in documentation match source code (e.g., a Go test that parses markdown and compares against reflection)
3. **Diagram versioning**: Tag mermaid diagrams with the Go module version they correspond to, enabling drift detection after refactors
4. **Calibration documentation**: `CALIBRATION.md` was 100% accurate - maintain this quality standard as the calibration system evolves

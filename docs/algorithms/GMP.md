# GMP-Based Calculator

## Overview

The GMP-based calculator utilizes the [GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library (GMP)](https://gmplib.org/) to perform Fibonacci calculations. GMP is widely regarded as the fastest library for arbitrary-precision arithmetic, often outperforming Go's standard `math/big` library for extremely large numbers (> 100 million bits).

This implementation uses the **Fast Doubling** algorithm, identical to the standard `"fast"` strategy, but delegates all arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, squaring) to GMP's highly optimized C assembly routines.

## Requirements

To use this calculator, you must have the GMP library and its development headers installed on your system.

### Installation

**Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt-get install libgmp-dev
```

**macOS (via Homebrew):**
```bash
brew install gmp
```

**Fedora/Red Hat:**
```bash
sudo dnf install gmp-devel
```

**Windows:**
Requires MinGW or WSL with libgmp installed.

## Compilation

Because this implementation relies on CGO and an external C library, it is hidden behind a build tag (`gmp`) to prevent build failures on systems without GMP.

```bash
# Build with GMP support
go build -tags gmp -o fibcalc ./cmd/fibcalc
```

## Auto-Registration

When built with `-tags=gmp`, the GMP calculator auto-registers itself via an `init()` function:

```go
//go:build gmp

func init() {
    RegisterCalculator("gmp", func() coreCalculator { return &GMPCalculator{} })
}
```

This means no manual registration is needed — the `"gmp"` algorithm becomes available in `GlobalFactory()` automatically.

## Usage

### Go API

```go
// GMP auto-registers when built with -tags=gmp
factory := fibonacci.GlobalFactory()
calc, err := factory.Get("gmp")  // available only with gmp build tag
if err != nil {
    // GMP not available (built without -tags=gmp)
}
result, err := calc.Calculate(ctx, progressChan, 0, 100_000_000, fibonacci.Options{})
```

### Running Tests with GMP

```bash
# Run all tests with GMP support
go test -tags=gmp -v ./internal/fibonacci/

# Run benchmarks with GMP
go test -tags=gmp -bench=BenchmarkGMP -benchmem ./internal/fibonacci/

# Compare GMP vs native algorithms
go test -tags=gmp -bench='Benchmark(FastDoubling|GMP)' -benchmem ./internal/fibonacci/
```

## Performance

GMP excels at extremely high precision. For inputs N < 1,000,000, Go's native `math/big` (and especially the optimized `bigfft` implementation used in the `"fast"` strategy) is often competitive or even faster due to CGO overhead. However, for N > 100,000,000, GMP's hand-tuned assembly loops typically provide a significant speed advantage.

### CGO Overhead

Each call to a GMP function incurs CGO overhead (typically 50-100ns per call). For small numbers, this overhead dominates the actual computation time, making native Go faster. The crossover point where GMP becomes faster depends on the specific hardware and operation, but is generally around N = 1,000,000.

## Implementation Details

- **Algorithm**: Fast Doubling (iterative, MSB-to-LSB)
- **Arithmetic**: Uses `github.com/ncw/gmp` bindings to call `libgmp`
- **Memory Management**: Reuses `gmp.Int` instances to minimize allocation overhead
- **File**: `internal/fibonacci/calculator_gmp.go`
- **Name()**: Returns `"GMP (Fast Doubling)"`
- **Registration**: `"gmp"` key in the calculator factory

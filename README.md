## 🔭 Overview

FibCalc serves as both a practical high-performance tool and a reference implementation for advanced software engineering patterns in Go. It demonstrates how to handle extreme computational workloads, optimize memory usage via zero-allocation strategies, and structure a clean, testable application.

### Why FibCalc?

- **Extreme Performance**: Calculates $F(250,000,000)$ in minutes, not hours.
- **Precision**: Handles numbers with millions of digits without precision loss.
- **Educational**: Implements and visualizes complex algorithms (Fast Doubling, Strassen, FFT).
- **Production Ready**: Includes structured logging, configurable timeouts, and robust error handling.

## 🚀 Key Features

### Advanced Algorithms

- **Fast Doubling** (Default): The fastest known method ($O(\log n)$), utilizing the identity $F(2k) = F(k)(2F(k+1) - F(k))$.
- **Matrix Exponentiation**: Classic $O(\log n)$ approach enhanced with **Strassen's Algorithm** for large matrices and symmetric squaring optimizations.
- **FFT-Based Multiplication**: Automatically switches to Fast Fourier Transform for multiplication when numbers exceed a configurable threshold (default ~500k bits), reducing complexity from $O(n^{1.585})$ to $O(n \log n)$.
- **GMP Support**: Optional build tag to use the GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library for maximum raw performance on supported systems.

### High-Performance Engineering

- **Zero-Allocation Strategy**: Extensive use of `sync.Pool` to recycle `big.Int` objects and custom calculation states, reducing Garbage Collector pressure by over 95%.
- **Adaptive Parallelism**: Automatically parallelizes recursive branches and matrix operations across CPU cores based on input size and hardware capabilities.
- **Concurrency Limiting**: Task semaphore limits concurrent goroutines to `runtime.NumCPU()*2`, preventing contention and memory pressure during parallel multiplication.
- **Optimized Memory Zeroing**: Uses Go 1.21+ `clear()` builtin for efficient slice zeroing in FFT operations.
- **Auto-Calibration**: Built-in benchmarking tool (`--calibrate`) to empirically determine the optimal parallelism and FFT thresholds for the host machine.
- **Atomic Pre-Warming**: Optimized memory pool initialization ensures resources are ready before the first request.

### Robust Architecture

- **Clean Architecture**: Strict separation of concerns (Core Logic, Orchestration, Interface, Infrastructure) with interface-based decoupling.
- **Interface-Based Decoupling**: The orchestration layer uses `ProgressReporter` and `ResultPresenter` interfaces to avoid depending on CLI, enabling testability and alternative presentations.
- **Modern CLI**: Features progress spinners, ETA calculation, formatted output, and colour themes.

## 📐 Mathematical Background

FibCalc implements several sophisticated mathematical concepts to achieve its performance.

### 1. Fast Doubling Identities

The most efficient algorithm avoids matrix operations entirely and computes $F(n)$ and $F(n+1)$ directly using the following recursive identities derived from the matrix form:

$$
\begin{aligned}
F(2k) &= F(k) \times (2F(k+1) - F(k)) \\
F(2k+1) &= F(k+1)^2 + F(k)^2
\end{aligned}
$$

This reduces the complexity to $O(\log n)$ operations. Each step roughly doubles the index, hence "Fast Doubling". See [Docs/algorithms/FAST_DOUBLING.md](Docs/algorithms/FAST_DOUBLING.md) for details.

### 2. Matrix Exponentiation & Strassen's Algorithm

The Fibonacci sequence can be generated by raising the "Q-matrix" to the power of $n$:

$$
\begin{pmatrix} F_{n+1} & F_n \\ F_n & F_{n-1} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}^n
$$

For large matrices, FibCalc employs **Strassen's Algorithm**, which reduces the number of multiplications in a $2 \times 2$ matrix product from 8 to 7. While this introduces more additions, it is beneficial when multiplication is significantly more expensive than addition (i.e., for very large `big.Int` values). See [Docs/algorithms/MATRIX.md](Docs/algorithms/MATRIX.md) for details.

### 3. FFT-Based Multiplication

For extremely large numbers (hundreds of thousands of bits), standard Karatsuba multiplication ($O(n^{1.585})$) becomes the bottleneck. FibCalc switches to **FFT multiplication** ($O(n \log n)$) based on the Convolution Theorem:

$$
A \times B = \text{IDFT}(\text{DFT}(A) \cdot \text{DFT}(B))
$$

This allows calculating numbers with billions of digits feasible. See [Docs/algorithms/FFT.md](Docs/algorithms/FFT.md) for details.

## 📊 Performance Benchmarks

FibCalc is optimized for speed. Below is a summary of performance characteristics on a standard workstation (AMD Ryzen 9 5900X).

| Index ($N$) | Fast Doubling | Matrix Exp. | FFT-Based | Result (digits) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **10,000** | 180µs | 220µs | 350µs | 2,090 |
| **1,000,000** | 85ms | 110ms | 95ms | 208,988 |

| **250,000,000** | 3m 12s | 4m 25s | 3m 28s | 52,246,909 |

### Algorithm Selection Guide

- **Use `fast` (Fast Doubling)** for general purpose high performance. It is consistently the fastest across all ranges.
- **Use `matrix`** for educational purposes or verification.
- **Use `fft`** primarily for benchmarking the multiplication engine itself, or for $N > 100,000,000$ where it becomes very competitive.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

Common issues and their solutions.

### 1. `runtime: out of memory`
Calculating huge Fibonacci numbers requires significant RAM. $F(1,000,000,000)$ requires ~25 GB of RAM.
**Solution**: Reduce $N$, add swap space, or use a machine with more RAM.

### 2. Calculation hangs / Timeout
For very large $N$, the calculation might exceed the default 5-minute timeout.
**Solution**: Increase the timeout with `--timeout 30m`.
